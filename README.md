# Abstract
The aim of this research is to investigate how graph convolutional neural networks can 1
enhance the accuracy of predictions. In our experiments, we examine the accuracy of predictions on a 2
dataset that has been truncated. We then look the prediction made by averaging the parameters of two 3
truncated datasets to determine if that assumption improves performance. This is done by applying 4
the methodological framework of the Simplified Graph Convolutional Neural Network(SGC) to Cora 5
dataset. By selecting nodes with three distinct patterns, we investigate the impact of node removal on 6
prediction accuracy. Insights gained from these experiments shed light on which node patterns are 7
crucial for optimizing the performance of SGC. If node removal is focused on a localized selection, 8
the results demonstrate that SGC effectively utilizes the local information of network nodes. In this 9
case, the applied method of improving the SGCâ€™s accuracy, has better performance compared to a 10
case where the nodes were randomly dropped 11
